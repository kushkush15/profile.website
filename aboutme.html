                <div id="careers"> 
                    <p>This year I’m taking Electronics, Digital       Technologies, and Business Pathways. Some jobs that     these subjects lead to are:
                            - Engineer
                            - Investment Banker
                            - Software developer
                            - Charted Accountant
                        I personally am interested in the IT sector of the job market (therefore DIT) but I also like Economics as a close second.</p>
