                    <h4>Personal Statement</h4>
                    <p>Interests: I'm interested in more math and technology based jobs such as civil engineering, investment banking, data analyst, accounting, architectural technologist. My goal in any of my future careers is to finish and manage projects successfully. I chose these types of careers because they allow me to manage, explore, and communicate with others in the same type of job. To get to these jobs I have taken eletronics, business and digital technologies this year.

                    <p>Some of my strengths are emotional intelligence, critical thinking, good presentation skills, leadership, competitive, allocating responsibilities. This means I make a good team player who has lots to bring to the group alignment along with my skills.

                    <p>Some of my weaknesses are procrasination, impatient, time management, and creativity. To elimate these weaknesses I have started utilising apps such as timelimit freedom, notes, and google calender. Limiting my social media time means I have to start working on my task and this helps me minimise procrasination. Using notes and google calender allows me to be aware of all my tasks for time management. Furthermore because I'm working on time management I am becoming more patient.

                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p>I did my Primary School Education in Willowbank Primary School but then after that I moved to Mission Heights for years 7 and 8 because I didn't get into Sommerville (out of zone). After that I find myself at Botany Downs Secondary College. I hope to go to Auckland University or AUT, however my dream university would be Melbourne University.</p>
